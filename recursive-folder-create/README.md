# Recursive Date Folder Creation 
The function that gave me this idea - was really pleased with it, and thought I'd put it somewhere with my name attached to it, which is not to say that I OWN the idea or anything to do with it. 

Node app that takes in 2 dates with a -s start and -e end flag respectively, and creates a folder locally for each day in between the dates passed in as params.

## To run:
```bash
git clone this repo 
cd bits-of-code-by-me 
cd recursive-folder-create 
npm install 
node app.js -s 2022-04-27T00:00:00.000Z -e 2022-06-20T23:59:59.295Z
```
